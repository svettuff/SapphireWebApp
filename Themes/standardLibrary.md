## Basics of Working with the C++ Standard Library

The C++ Standard Library (STL, Standard Template Library) provides a powerful set of tools for handling data, performing algorithms, and managing streams. It includes containers, algorithms, string operations, mathematical functions, and much more.
Simply put, people much smarter than us have packed what we would otherwise write from scratch (spending a lot of time) into the standard library.

### What Does the C++ Standard Library Include?

**Containers** — Data structures for storing objects:

- Sequences (`std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::deque`).
- Associative containers (`std::map`, `std::set`).
- Direct access containers (`std::array`, `std::string`).

**Algorithms** — Ready-to-use functions for data manipulation:

- Search, sorting, filtering, iteration, etc. (`std::sort`, `std::find`, `std::accumulate`).

**Iterators** — A way to work with container elements:

- Abstract from the storage method (`begin`, `end`).

**Function Objects and Lambda Functions:**

- For flexible handling of container elements.

**Stream Handling:**

- Input and output (`std::cin`, `std::cout`, `std::fstream`).

**Multithreading:**

- Thread management (`std::thread`, `std::mutex`).

**Additional Components:**

- Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`).
- Timers and clocks (`std::chrono`).
- String and numeric conversions (`std::to_string`, `std::stoi`).
