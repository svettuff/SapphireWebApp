## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where everything is organized around objects. An object is an entity that combines data (properties) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.

### Real-World Examples

**Car**

Properties: `color`, `brand`, `year of manufacture`.

Methods: `drive`, `brake`, `honk`.

**Person**

Properties: `name`, `age`, `height`.

Methods: `speak`, `walk`, `sleep`.

### Key Principles of OOP

**Classes and Objects**

A class is a "blueprint" for creating objects (instances of a class).

**Encapsulation**

Hiding the internal details of an object.

**Inheritance**

The ability of one class to inherit properties and methods from another.

**Polymorphism**

The ability of objects to behave differently depending on the context.

### Why is OOP convenient?

- The code becomes closer to the real world and easier to understand.
- Easier to reuse code.
- More convenient to scale and modify projects.
